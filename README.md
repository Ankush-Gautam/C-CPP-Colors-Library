# C-CPP-Colors-Library
I made a the terminal codes as a library so it would be easy to access each colors without remembering syntax and colorcodes. 
As the terminal has two types of colors: lighter and darker so i have assigned it accordingly.

- black(); is the black color which has 0 value in the terminal
- darkblue(); is the dark blue color which has value as 1 in the terminal.
- Similarly, blue(); is the lighter blue.

## Total of 16 colors are there which changes text colors only.
    If you want to change the background color just use system("color @{code}"); //that's easy one
